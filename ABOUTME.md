- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KayaneSilva and I'm 23 years old. I'm from SÃ£o JoÃ£o del Rei (MG) and I'm finishing my graduation at Control and Automation engineering at UFLA.
- ğŸ‘€ Despite my course, my passion is in development and UX. In college I learned about C++ and found out how much I liked coding. I focus my experiences during the course in this area and did my scientific initiation, internship and Thesis as a developer.
- ğŸ‘€ Another characteristic about me is that I love to read. I can imagine a new world with the characters and their voices. I'm very creative.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working with Javascript, Node.js, Angular and C#.
